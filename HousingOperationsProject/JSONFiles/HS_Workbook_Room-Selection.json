At that point, the student in the roommate group who is selecting the housing should select a space for themselves and then select a space for their roommate(s), as long as there are enough open spaces to accommodate the group in the same apartment/suite/room. What to Do if There is No Housing Available That Accommodates the Size of Your Group? The most important conversation topic you NEED to have before going to the portal in early December to select your housing What do we want to do if we cannot all get housing together? Example: If you are linked with 3 roommates because you really want to assign yourselves to a University Commons suite but there are no suites with 4 open spaces in the same suite – what can you do? Options: All 4 of you can be logged into the portal at the same time and each of you can assign yourselves individually to the housing of your choice. Maybe 2 of you will assign yourselves to 2 open spaces in one University Commons suite and 2 of you will assign yourselves to 2 open spaces in another University Commons suite. Maybe there is a Perkins Green apartment that is open and one of you can assign everyone in the group to that open apartment. If one person in the group assigns everyone in the group, other members of the group can sign in to the portal and change their assignment if they want to. Some members of the group may want to select a room and others may want to add themselves to a waitlist. You will have from the date and time that your appointment time starts until the date that Room Selection ends to select your room or do a room swap.   Step-05 How to do a Room Swap? You can only do this as an individual Follow the steps below if you have selected your housing and decide you want to look for a different housing. 1. Click on Room Selection on the top menu bar. Click on Room Swap — this will allow you to browse what rooms and spaces are available while you remain assigned to the room you have previously selected. 2.

On the Room Selection — Assign/Confirm Bed(s) page you will then assign your bed space and then click Reserve Beds. This will remove you and your roommate from your original assignment and reassign you and your roommate to your newly selected location. You will have five minutes to select your bed before the system times out. You will see the time countdown on the screen.   Step-06 How the Waitlist Works? Before you begin searching for a wait list, keep in mind: The best strategy is to select housing for yourself if it is available. It is anticipated that some students will not find available housing and will need to put themselves on the waitlist. (See below how we will work with students on the waitlist) You cannot select housing and in addition put your name on a wait list. If you add yourself to a waitlist, you do so as an individual. Linked roommates cannot add themselves together on a waitlist. You are no longer a roommate group. Putting your name on a wait list for a certain type of housing does not guarantee that you will be assigned to that particular type of housing. You may be assigned to housing that you did not ask for, or you may be assigned to short-term housing. You can search for and select up to 5 wait lists. You can see where your name ranks on a wait list when you go to select it. Steps to Find & Add Yourself to a Waitlist? 1. On the top menu bar click Waitlist Information. 2. Click on Room Type. 3. If you click on All Room Types, a list of all the waitlists will appear along with the number of applicants on that waitlist. 4.

If you made a mistake or change your mind, you can click on Remove Yourself from the Waitlist(s). 6. When you are finished in the Waitlist Information section, click on Move to Next Section. Note: Waitlist Information will be grayed out and unavailable until your appointment date and time.   How assignments will be made for students on the waitlists? After the Room Selection process is over, the housing assignment staff will monitor spaces that open due to cancellations from students that renewed or selected a space during Room Selection. The student will receive an email informing them of their assignment and can look at their confirmation page of their contract to see any related roommate information."}]}],"warnings":[]}
