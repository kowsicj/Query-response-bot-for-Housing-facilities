You may not leave belongings with a roommate or a friend who may be staying in RIT housing for the summer to use, store, or watch over. All belongings must be taken off campus.

To find out more and to reserve your space for using this moving and summer storage space, visit CampusCarriers.com or call (866) 739-0095. Resolve any undocumented damages in your apartment/suite/room. Contact Donna Black, Housing Operations, at dkbapt@rit.edu to note who is responsible. Unresolved damages will be billed equally to all students on contract for spring semester. You may submit maintenance requests online at myhousing.rit.edu. Submitting a request does not negate your responsibility if repairs were a result of negligence and/or misconduct. Return your cable box to Time Warner, if applicable. Return the apartment/suite/room to move-in condition. Remove all trash, food, and unwanted items, vacuum, and wipe down shelves. Forty foot dumpsters will be available in each complex for you to dispose of large items. Donate any unwanted goods to Goodbye Goodbuy!
